    <h2>HISTORY OF AIRPLANES</h2>
    <p>In 1799, George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as 
    a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.
    Cayley was building and flying models of fixed-wing aircraft as early as 1803, and
    he built a successful passenger-carrying glider in 1853.</p>
    <p>Immediately after the Wright Brothers make their first powered flights in 1903,
         they begin to develop their experimental aircraft into a marketable product. 
         By 1905 they have what they consider to be a "practical flying machine.
         " Other experimenters learn of their work and begin to build on their success. 
         By 1906, would-be pilots are making tentative hops in uncontrollable aircraft. 
         By 1909, after watching the Wrights' flying demonstrations, they grasp the 
         brilliance and necessity of three-axis aerodynamic control. 
         The performance of their aircraft quickly catch up to, then surpass Wright Flyers.
          The capabilities of and the uses for aircraft expand as designers and pilots introduce float planes,
           flying boats, passenger aircraft, observation platforms fitted with radios and wireless telegraphs, 
           fighters, and bombers. As World War I  approaches, aircraft have become an essential part of war and peace.</p>
